# Example-analyses
Example analyses making extensive use of nelpy.

## Examples include:
  * [**LinearTrackDemo**.ipynb](../master/LinearTrackDemo.ipynb)—using position and spike data (CA1) to estimate spatial tuning curves and identify putative place cells from a 15 minute linear track run session.
  *  [**WMazeDemo**.ipynb](../master/WMazeDemo.ipynb)—using position and spike data (CA1) to estimate 2D spatial tuning curves from two 15 minute w-maze sessions.
  * more coming soon!
